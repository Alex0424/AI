## What is AI and Machine Learnings

Machine Learning is a subfield of AI

`Artificial Intelligense`(`Machine Learning`(`Deap Learning`))
- `AI`(`ML`(`DL`))

## AI

## Machine Learning

Machine Learning
- System that trains a model from input data

Most common classes of Machine Learning models
- unsupervised ML models
  - no tags
    - grouping current data into groups to find patterns
- supervised ML models
  - have label data / label tag
    - {For Example: [name, type, number]}
      - is used to predict data from past examples

## Deep Learning

**Deep Learning** uses **Artificial Neural Networks** to process complex patterns than **Machine Learning**

Inspired by human brain

Made out of many interconnected nodes/neurons

Semi Supervised Learning
- trains on small amount of labeled data
  - learn basic concept of a task
- trains on big amount of unlabeled data
  - generalize(make data more widespread) by new examples

### Deep Learning Model Types

Discriminative
- Used to classify or predict
- Typically trained on a dataset of labeled data
- Learns the relationship between the features of the data points and the labels

Generative
- Generates new data that is similar to data it was trained on
- Understands distribution of data and how likely a given example is
- Predict next word in a sequence

## Generative AI

Generative AI
- subset of Deep Learning
- Is Natural Language Image, Audio
- Not a Number, Descrit, Class probability
  - That is calculated by the formula `y = f(x)`

Generative AI uses very larga data from multiple sources across the internet to build a foundation Language Model (Also called Foundation Model)
- Pathwats Language Model (PaLM)
  - PaLM API simplifies monitoring deployment and training LLM
- Language Model for Dialogue applications (LaMDA)
- GPT

What is Generative AI:
- generates new content based on what it has learned from existing content.
- GenAI uses the statistical model to predict the expected response might be.

### Prompt

Is input that users sends into the GenAI
- quality of input determines the quality output

### Input & Output

Image
- Text
- Image
- Video

Text (Input)
- Text (output)
  - Translation
  - Summarization
  - Question Answering
  - Grammar Correction
- Image (output)
  - Image generation
  - Video Generation
- Audio (output)
  - Text-To-Speach
- Decisions (output)
  - Play Games
