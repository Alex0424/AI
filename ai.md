## What is AI and Machine Learnings

Machine Learning is a subfield of AI

`Artificial Intelligense`(`Machine Learning`(`Deap Learning`))
- `AI`(`ML`(`DL`))

## AI



## Deep Learning

**Deep Learning** uses **Artificial Neural Networks** to process complex patterns than **Machine Learning**

Inspired by human brain

Made out of many interconnected nodes/neurons

Semi Supervised Learning
- trains on small amount of labeled data
  - learn basic concept of a task
- trains on big amount of unlabeled data
  - generalize(make data more widespread) by new examples

### Deep Learning Model Types

Discriminative
- Used to classify or predict
- Typically trained on a dataset of labeled data
- Learns the relationship between the features of the data points and the labels

Generative
- Generates new data that is similar to data it was trained on
- Understands distribution of data and how likely a given example is
- Predict next word in a sequence

## Vortex AI

Model Garden

pre trained model by google using:
- Language
- Vision

## Large Language Models (LLMs)

Is a subset of Deep Learning
